# Dreamkart Backend Documentation

This directory contains automatically generated documentation for the Dreamkart backend application. The documentation is organized by core components: Models, Services, and Routes.

## Structure

*   **`docs/models/`**: Contains detailed documentation for each Mongoose model used in the application. Each Markdown file describes the model's interface, schema fields, methods, and hooks.

*   **`docs/services/`**: Contains documentation for the application's service layer. Each Markdown file explains the purpose of the service, its helper methods, public methods, and dependencies.

*   **`docs/routes/`**: Contains documentation for the API routes. Each Markdown file details the available endpoints, their descriptions, access levels, request bodies, and expected responses.

## How to Use

Navigate into the respective subdirectories (`models`, `services`, `routes`) to find detailed information about each component. Each file is named after the component it describes (e.g., `product.md` for the Product model, service, or routes).

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the backend's architecture and functionality, facilitating development, maintenance, and onboarding.
